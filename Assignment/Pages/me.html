            This is <b>Yizhou Tian</b> (u7244193), an ANU student, programmer, and web design beginner. I like to read and watch TV shows and movies. A few years ago, I watched the fantasy drama TV series, <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and I loved it. I was attracted by the fascinating imagination and the magnificent worldview in the show. Thus, I decided to build this website about <i>Game of Thrones</i>.

        <p>
            The <i>Game of Thrones</i> is adapted from the famous epic fantasy novel <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> by <b>George R.R. Martin</b>. This TV show depends on an enormous fictional history and creates hundreds of interesting characters. It&#39;s hard for audiences to remember all the important historical events and the relationship between different characters, even for me. So I developed this website for users to find out information about <i>Game of Thrones</i> easily and better understand the show. This website can also be propaganda for the show, encouraging people to watch it. Compared to reading its original book, users can search for the information with a directed focus on the website.

            From the website, you can find information about the famous characters from <i>Game of Thrones</i>, the Great Houses and the history of the realms. Users can also write feedback about my website. The website also includes the site map and the source log. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Hope you enjoy your journey on the land of <i>Westeros</i>!
