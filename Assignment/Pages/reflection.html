            About My Site (Reflection)
        </h1>

        <p>
            My website is about the famous fantasy TV show <i>Game of Thrones</i>. This website is developed for both fans of this show and those who didn&#39;t watch this show to have a better understanding of the background setting and the stories.         
        </p>

            There are many parts I&#39;m proud of on my website. First, this website includes a large amount of JavaScript functions. For example, I enabled the filtering function in my photo gallery. Click different selection buttons in the gallery, it will only show the photos with that specific feature. I also created a colour-change animation when the mouse over a link and a slide show of book covers by JavaScript. Multiple modes are available on this website, including the light mode, the dark mode, and the printer-friendly mode (This function is also associated with js code). Every mode won&#39;t interfere with each other. In addition, this website also has several social networking functions. Users can share my website on Facebook or Twitter. They can also view the Facebook posts relevant to Game of Thrones on the website.

            I started developing this website on 2nd Mar and finished it on 21st May. In this process, I&#39;ve learned a lot of techniques about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. W3Schools is a very helpful platform. It has a lot of useful tutorials on web development. Its knowledge is very comprehensive. When I have difficulties on my web, the first place I found for help is W3Schools. I&#39;ve also learned many strategies for web design, to meet users&#39; requirements. Find the balance between aesthetics, readability and functionality.  </p>

            As a beginner in web development, there are still many things I need to improve on. In the beginning, I didn&#39;t make a good plan for web development. I didn&#39;t leave much space for further improvement. When I needed to add some new functions in Assignment 2 and Assignment 3, such as the image map and social feeds, I had to largely modify the design of my website and it wasted a substantial amount of time. Also, some JavaScript is irrelevant to my website content, for example, the pop-up window of the image map and showing the current time. Remove these functions and the website is still well-functioning.

            There are a lot of things I can do better next time. In the first assignment, I didn&#39;t arrange my time wisely. I spent too much time on the functional pages such as the feedback page and the source log but neglect the main structure of the website. I should have focused more on the content users will be interested in and spent more time on the quality and coherence of the website. I need to have a more comprehensive design in the beginning, considering the extensibility of the website, so I can easily add more functions to the website. I&#39;ll also improve my slide-show image. Furthermore, I should have put more information on the home page. My homepage only has a background image and a menu, and most of the information is hidden on the second-level pages, which is not very friendly to users who visit my website for the first time. I should move more content to the index page. This issue could have been solved at the designing step.

            In general, this web development assignment is a very interesting experience. I learned a lot about HTML and JavaScript. I will gain experience from my mistakes and improve them in my next project.
